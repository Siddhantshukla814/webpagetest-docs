## Running Tests
:::faqs

### How do you define a test run?
A test run on WebPageTest is defined as a single run within a test set up to measure webpage performance on a specific browser and location. For example, if you run a 5-run test with **Repeat View**, then that counts as 10 test runs.    

### What countries and browsers do you support with the WebPageTest API?
With WebPageTest API, you can test across 30 locations worldwide, including mainland China.  

WebPageTest API is always up-to-date on the current version of every browser and you can test on Chrome (stable, beta, canary), Firefox (stable, beta, ESR), Microsoft Edge (dev) and Brave.  

WebPageTest API also supports mobile emulation testing. You can test mobile content by emulating an Android browser by passing **“mobile=1”** as an API option. 

### Does the API support testing on real mobile devices?
The WebPageTest API currently does not support testing on real mobile devices at this moment. For mobile testing, we currently recommend using mobile emulation by passing **"mobile=1"** as an API parameter.
### What metrics can I access with the API?
You can access [all the performance metrics](/metrics) that you would when you run a manual test on WebPageTest, as well as the film strip view and video capture. WebPageTest API also gives you additional metrics that are only currently exposed in the JSON and XML results, not in the UI itself.

### How long will my test results be stored?  
You will have access to all the tests you run via WebPageTest API for 13 months. This also enables you to look at year-over-year performance analyses and trends. 

### Is there a daily limit for the test runs?  
There is a monthly limit on the total tests you can run with the WebPageTest API, based on the subscription plan you choose. There is currently no daily limit on top of that monthly limit.  

### How can I see how many tests I have remaining?
You can always see how many tests you have remaining in your current month by looking at the **Remaining Runs** value under the **Subscription Plan** section of your **My Account** page. 

You can also programmaticaly check how many tests you have remaining by using the [testBalance.php](/api/reference/#checking-remaining-test-balance) endpoint of the API itself.

### Do you provide any integrations that I can use with the API? 
We currently support the following integrations:

- **[WebPageTest API Wrapper for NodeJS](https://github.com/marcelduran/webpagetest-api)**  
An npm package that wraps WebPageTest API for NodeJS as a module and a command-line tool  
- **[WebPageTest GitHub Action](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest-github-action)**   
A GitHub Action that lets you automatically run tests against WebPageTest on code changes, set and enforce performance budgets, and have performance data automatically added to your pull requests to move the performance conversation directly into your existing development workflow.
- **[WebPageTest Slack Bot](https://github.com/WebPageTest/webpagetest-slack)**  
A Slack bot that lets you run tests against WebPageTest from within Slack. Once the tests are complete, a copy of the waterfall and a link to the full results will be posted in your Slack channel, helping you to easily troubleshoot and diagnose performance issues directly from your Slack development channels.
- **[WebPageTest VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WebPageTest.wpt-vscode-extension)**  
The Visual Studio Code(Vscode) Extension for WebPageTest lets you run tests against WebPageTest from within Vscode, helping you to easily troubleshoot and diagnose performance issues directly from Vscode and possibly refactor the code if needed.

There are also several existing integrations built by our community members that you can try out to build on top of the WebPageTest API. [Check out some of them here.](/api/integrations/#community-built-integrations)

All our subscription plans offer the same features and capabilities, and the pricing is based on the total tests you want to run per month.

You’ll continue to have access to the WebPageTest account and history of the manual tests (under **Test History**) that you ran while signed in to that account. Please note all subscriptions are automatically renewed unless explicitly cancelled.

### Why does my credit card/bank statement show a charge for Braintree.com?
Braintree is our payment gateway provider for the site, so your charge description might show as a charge to Braintree. It is up to your individual payment provider to determine the best description for the charge, and the description is subject to change after the typical 7-day settlement period. If you should have any questions, please contact your payment provider after the settlement period to see how they handle the charge description.  

### Can I add more users to the plan?
Currently, we only support one user account to sign in and set up your account to purchase the WebPageTest API. However, you can generate up to 30 keys for multiple use cases and teams, from a single WebPageTest API account. Generate a new key by clicking on **+ API consumer**.  

We have plans to support adding multiple users and defining roles in the future.
