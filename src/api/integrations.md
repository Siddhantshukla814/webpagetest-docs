WebPageTest provides integrations to make it easier to use the API with your existing tooling, as well as to consume the WebPageTest information in new and interesting ways.

## Officially Supported Integrations

### WebPageTest GitHub Action

WebPageTest's GitHub Action lets you automatically run tests against WebPageTest on code changes. You can set and enforce performance budgets, and have performance data automatically added to your pull requets to move the performance conversation directly into your existing development workflow.

Features:

- Automatically run WebPageTest against code changes
- Set and enforce budgets for any metric WebPageTest can surface (spoiler alert: there are a lot)
- Complete control over WebPageTest test settings (authentication, custom metrics, scripting, etc)
- Automatically create comments on new pull requests with key metrics, waterfall and more.

WebPageTest API Wrapper is a NPM package that wraps WebPageTest API for NodeJS as a module and a command-line tool. It provides some syntactic sugar over the raw API, enabling easier integration into your existing worfklows, including built in polling for results, pingback support and more.

Features:

- Built in performance budget testing
- Convenient CLI to simplify integrating with your existing CI/CD tooling
- Polling and pingback functionality to make it easier to get test results as soon as tests are completed

The WebPageTest Slack bot lets you run tests against WebPageTest from within Slack. Once the tests are complete, a copy of the waterfall and a link to the full results will be posted in your Slack channel, helping you to easily troubleshoot and diagnose performance issues directly from your Slack development channels.

Features:

- Run WebPageTest from within Slack, and get the results posted back automatically.
- Full access to WebPageTest's 30+ test locations.

The Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Extension for WebPageTest lets you run tests against WebPageTest from within VSCode. Once the tests are complete, some of the performance metrics, a copy of the waterfall, screenshot, and a link to the full results will be displayed in VSCode, right where you are developing, helping you to easily troubleshoot and diagnose performance issues directly from VSCode and possibly refactor the code if needed.

Features:

- Run WebPageTest from within VSCode, and get the results posted back automatically.
- Full access to the underlying WebPageTest API
- Test performance on local code changes, as you're making the change
